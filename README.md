# AmbiCam

Scripts for extracting LED Colors for "AmbiLight"-Clones using a RaspberryPi and the PiCamera.

**NOTE** This is a pre-alpha, work-in-progress, hobby project and is not (yet) destined to work for anybody else than my setup.

## TODO

* Use Hyperion LED geometry (from config)
* Fix / re-enable custom warping of the border regions
* Configurable border, offset, blurring and mean calculations
* Proper blackborder detection
